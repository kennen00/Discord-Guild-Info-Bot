-Bot Functionality
    -First, bot reads in a message from the specific bot channel

        -If the message contains a question / words that pertain to a question that in can answer with it's current data,
        then send a message answering the question

        -If there is not enough data, send the question as a private message to the administration question channel

            -The question is answered by an administrator, and then that answer / question is put into the bot database
            (initially manual, may add automatic functionality at a later time)
